                            Hugh Jackman, named after the equally impressive actor, acquired 8th place in the 2014 RoboBoat competition.  Even though Hugh Jackman's performance did not reach our high standards, numerous positive changes were enacted on Hugh compared to his past configurations.  Hugh has completely new, taller hulls which allows our electronics to be more protected from water splash.  Additionally, with a brand new electric box, Hugh is more organized and more efficient than ever.  With all of these revisions, Hugh has successfully paved the way for future iterations to perform exceedingly well.  UM::Autonomy's 2014 goal was to practice multiple, full-scale tests including our own mock competition and general testing    in the Lurie Fountain.

                            Eve took 4th place in the 6th annual RoboBoat competition. The main differences between Eve and her predecessors include a major camera upgrade, as well as a new hull shape and propulsion configuration that allowed for much greater maneuverability, though she used the same electrical system as her predecessor Serenity. Eve was also accompanied by a small land vehicle named WALL-E who was designed to handle the amphibious landing challenge. Eve also featured a NERF gun that was to be used for a shooting challenge. The main focus of UM::Autonomy during this year was quality manufacturing and thorough testing.

                            Serenity claimed 1st place at the 5th annual RoboBoat competition. Consistently completing the entire buoy course due to some major software upgrades and attempting the "Hot Sign"  and "Poker Chip" challenges. At 106 Lbs Serenity weighed in as UM::Autonomy's heaviest boat to date. Serenity's most notable differences from her predecessor Wolvemarine include an entirely new electrical system and vision system. Serenity did however use the same hulls as her predecessor Wolvemarine. Serenity was equipped with an Infrared Camera as well as a Water Cannon. The main focus of the team this year was the completion of the buoy course.
